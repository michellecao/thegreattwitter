Steps to commit your files:
1. "git add ." (add all changed files)
    or "git add path/to/the/file" to add the individual file.
2. "git status" to view the status of the files
3. "git commit -m "Importing my code" -a" (this command will commit all the files you added above)
4. "git push -u origin master" (this command will publish all the changes you made to bitbucket master branch)

git reset --hard origin/master
